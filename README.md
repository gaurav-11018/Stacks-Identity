# Stacks Identity

Welcome to the Stacks Identity project, a decentralized identity management solution built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity smart contract language.

With the Stacks Identity project, users can easily create and manage their own digital identity, and selectively share specific pieces of information with entities that require it. This helps protect users' privacy and reduces the risk of identity theft or fraud.

The Stacks Identity project is designed to be interoperable with other identity systems and platforms, enabling seamless integration and use across different applications and services. It is also built to be compliant with relevant regulations and standards, ensuring that it can be used in a wide range of industries and sectors.
